# User Management Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System

**Overview**
This project is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with a frontend built using React. It allows you to manage users, roles, and permissions efficiently. The system is designed with a "hacker-style" user interface, featuring neon green text and dark background. It also includes a footer with dynamic information, styled to look like a terminal.
It allows you to manage users and roles in a table format, with the ability to **add**, **edit**, and **delete users and roles**. Each user has a **name**, **role**, and **status (active/inactive)**.

**Features**
**User Creation:** Add new users quickly by filling out a simple form with their name, email, and role. The email field includes validation to ensure the format is correct before submission.
**User Management:** Modify existing users with ease. Just click the "Edit" button next to any user in the table, and the form will automatically populate with their current details for editing.
**User Deletion:** Remove users directly from the user table. Once deleted, their information will be permanently erased from the system.
**Mobile-First Design:** Enjoy seamless functionality across all devices. The app is fully responsive, ensuring that both tables and forms automatically adjust to fit different screen sizes, whether you're on a desktop or mobile.

**Hacker UI Mode:**
-Dark, Sleek Interface: Activate a stylish dark mode that gives your app a modern, hacker-inspired look. Perfect for those who love a clean, minimalist aesthetic with high contrast for better focus.
-Terminal-style Design: Mimic a terminal interface with text-based commands and neon highlights to give users the feel of navigating a real coding environment.
-Customizable Themes: Choose from a variety of hacker-themed skins or create your own to match your preferences. Whether you prefer a classic green-on-black or something more vibrant, the UI adapts to suit your style.
-Enhanced Visual Effects: Experience smooth animations and transitions that bring the "hacker" vibe to life, making your interactions with the app more immersive and engaging.
